## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases the creation of an interactive chatbot using the ChatGPT API, seamlessly integrated with web scraping to extract information from a specified website. The chatbot interacts through both the console and a simple Flask API.

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Environment Setup

- Acquire the necessary API key for ChatGPT and store it in a `.env` file:

  ```plaintext
  OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your_OpenAI_API_Key>
###  Install required libraries:
- pip install Flask requests beautifulsoup4 python-dotenv openai

## 2. Extracting Data
The script leverages Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing to extract relevant information from the provided website.
  
## 3. Processing Data
Extracted data is structured and utilized as input to the ChatGPT API for generating meaningful responses.

## 4. Implementing the Chatbot
The chatbot is built using the ChatGPT API and designed to take user inputs, process them, and generate suitable responses.

## 5. Console Demonstration
The chatbot functions seamlessly via the console, allowing users to interact, ask questions, and receive relevant responses.
## 🚀 Usage

### Console Interaction

```bash
# Run the Script
python chatbot.py

The chatbot will prompt you to ask questions or provide input. Type your queries, and the chatbot will generate responses based on the website data.

Chatbot: Hello! I am a chatbot. You can ask me anything about the website.
You: What is the website about?
Chatbot: Website data: [Title] Description: [Description] User input: What is the website about?

To exit the chat, type "exit," "quit," or "bye."
